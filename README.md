## **🎯 Objective**
The objective of **UNITYPATH** is to create a seamless volunteer matching platform that:
- Bridges the gap between organizations in need of volunteers and individuals who want to contribute.
- Enables efficient management of opportunities and volunteers.
- Promotes social change by supporting humanitarian, environmental, and community-building initiatives.

## **📦 Core Classes**
- **`Volunteer`:** This class represents a volunteer with attributes like `id`, `name`, `password`, and `skills`. It extends the abstract class `User` and provides the `viewOpportunities()` method for displaying available opportunities.
- **`Organization`:** Represents an organization that can post volunteer opportunities. Includes methods for managing organizations and interacting with the volunteer database.
- **`Opportunity`:** Represents a volunteer opportunity with fields like `title`, `requiredSkills`, `location`, and dates. This class manages the details of each opportunity.
- **`User (Abstract)`:** This base class holds common attributes like `id`, `name`, and `email` for both volunteers and organizations. It defines the abstract method `viewOpportunities()` to be implemented by subclasses.
- **`TestConnection`:** A utility class used to test the connection to a MySQL database, ensuring the system can interact with a database properly.
- **`DesignUtils`:** A utility class for formatting output, clearing the screen, and printing styled headers and messages, helping improve user interaction.

## **🧑‍💻 Core Principles of OOP**
The system follows key **Object-Oriented Programming** principles, such as:

1. **Encapsulation:** 
   - Each class has its own attributes and methods, ensuring the internal workings of each object are hidden and only relevant data is exposed.
   - Example: The `Volunteer` class encapsulates details like `name` and `skills`, while the `Opportunity` class encapsulates opportunity-specific details.

2. **Inheritance:**
   - The `User` class is an abstract base class that defines common properties like `id`, `name`, and `email`. Both `Volunteer` and `Organization` classes inherit from `User`, making the system extensible for future types of users.

3. **Polymorphism:**
   - The abstract method `viewOpportunities()` in the `User` class allows different subclasses (e.g., `Volunteer`, `Organization`) to provide their specific implementations of how opportunities are viewed.

4. **Abstraction:**
   - Complex logic, such as database connections or console clearing, is abstracted into utility methods like those in the `DesignUtils` and `TestConnection` classes, simplifying the user-facing functionality.
