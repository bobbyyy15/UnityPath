![UnityPath](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/92426150-ecaf-4041-b648-cacc6d714d46)


## **üìö Title and Purpose**
**UNITYPATH** is a platform designed to connect volunteers with organizations working toward social good. The system facilitates the matching of volunteers to opportunities based on their skills, availability, and interests, allowing for more efficient collaboration and fostering unity in the community.

---

## **üéØ Objective**
The objective of **UNITYPATH** is to create a seamless volunteer matching platform that:
- Bridges the gap between organizations in need of volunteers and individuals who want to contribute.
- Enables efficient management of opportunities and volunteers.
- Promotes social change by supporting humanitarian, environmental, and community-building initiatives.

## **üõ† Key Features**
- **Volunteer Registration & Login:** Volunteers can register and create profiles with their skills and interests, allowing for easy application to suitable opportunities.
- **Organization Registration & Login:** Organizations can post opportunities, review applications, and manage volunteer participation.
- **Opportunity Management:** Volunteers can view, apply, and track opportunities based on their skills and availability.
- **Search & Filter Functionality:** Volunteers can search for opportunities by location, skills, and other criteria to find the best fit.
- **Clear, User-Friendly Interface:** The system is designed with an easy-to-navigate UI that simplifies the interaction between volunteers and organizations.
- **Exit Handling:** The system includes clear exit options that allow users to cancel actions easily.

## **üì¶ Core Classes**
- **`Volunteer`:** This class represents a volunteer with attributes like `id`, `name`, `password`, and `skills`. It extends the abstract class `User` and provides the `viewOpportunities()` method for displaying available opportunities.
- **`Organization`:** Represents an organization that can post volunteer opportunities. Includes methods for managing organizations and interacting with the volunteer database.
- **`Opportunity`:** Represents a volunteer opportunity with fields like `title`, `requiredSkills`, `location`, and dates. This class manages the details of each opportunity.
- **`User (Abstract)`:** This base class holds common attributes like `id`, `name`, and `email` for both volunteers and organizations. It defines the abstract method `viewOpportunities()` to be implemented by subclasses.
- **`TestConnection`:** A utility class used to test the connection to a MySQL database, ensuring the system can interact with a database properly.
- **`DesignUtils`:** A utility class for formatting output, clearing the screen, and printing styled headers and messages, helping improve user interaction.

## **üßë‚Äçüíª Core Principles of OOP**
The system follows key **Object-Oriented Programming** principles, such as:

1. **Encapsulation:** 
   - Each class has its own attributes and methods, ensuring the internal workings of each object are hidden and only relevant data is exposed.
   - Example: The `Volunteer` class encapsulates details like `name` and `skills`, while the `Opportunity` class encapsulates opportunity-specific details.

2. **Inheritance:**
   - The `User` class is an abstract base class that defines common properties like `id`, `name`, and `email`. Both `Volunteer` and `Organization` classes inherit from `User`, making the system extensible for future types of users.

3. **Polymorphism:**
   - The abstract method `viewOpportunities()` in the `User` class allows different subclasses (e.g., `Volunteer`, `Organization`) to provide their specific implementations of how opportunities are viewed.

4. **Abstraction:**
   - Complex logic, such as database connections or console clearing, is abstracted into utility methods like those in the `DesignUtils` and `TestConnection` classes, simplifying the user-facing functionality.
